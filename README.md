# WebSockets in Spring Boot using STOMP

This project aims to explore and demonstrate the various use cases of WebSockets using STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) in a Spring Boot application.

## Overview

WebSockets allow for real-time, full-duplex communication between a client and a server. STOMP is a simple messaging protocol that complements WebSockets, providing a straightforward way to send and receive messages.

## Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Utilizes WebSockets to achieve real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients.
- **STOMP Protocol**: Utilizes STOMP for messaging, making it easy to send messages between server and clients.
- **Spring Boot Integration**: Integrates WebSockets and STOMP seamlessly into a Spring Boot application.

## Use Cases

This project explores various use cases, including but not limited to:

1. **Chat Applications**: Implementing real-time chat applications where users can send and receive messages instantly.
   
2. **Live Updates**: Providing live updates or notifications to clients in real-time.

3. **Collaborative Editing**: Enabling multiple users to collaborate on a document or project in real-time.

4. **Real-time Analytics**: Displaying real-time analytics or data updates to clients.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: A framework that simplifies the setup and development of new Spring applications.
- **WebSocket API**: The WebSocket API for enabling WebSocket communication.
- **STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol)**: A lightweight and easy-to-use messaging protocol for communication over WebSockets.
